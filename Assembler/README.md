## Why Elixir?
Because I'm curious about the functional paradigm.
I've already made an assembler before (see my C# implemention in [**Crimson-RFASM**](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/Crimson-RFASM)), so I can focus on learning the language without having to solve so many other problems at the same time.
Compiliation and assembly are (unlike linking) highly parallelisable because files are broadly independent of one-another - a perfect task for a highly concurrent language!
