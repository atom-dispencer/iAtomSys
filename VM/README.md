The virtual computer at the core of the iAtomSys ecosystem.

## Why Java?
Java was (and still is!) my 'mother-tongue' of programming - if you [_dig back many years_](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/MagiksMostEvile), you'll find my ancient adventures in modding Minecraft!
A virtual machine is a challenge I've never attempted, plus I have some interesting ideas for a user-interface, so I'd like to be able to implement that without too many worries over my tools.
